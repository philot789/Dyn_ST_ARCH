# Dynamic Spatiotemporal ARCH

Code and toy examples for the simulation and estimation of dynamic spatiotemporal ARCH models. For further details on the theoretical background and applications of the model, we refer to our arXiv discussion paper "Dynamic spatiotemporal ARCH models" by Philipp Otto, Osman Dogan, Suleyman Taspinar ( arXiv:2202.13856)
